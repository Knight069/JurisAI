            AI can be used to identify and review electronic data that is
            relevant to a legal case. This can help lawyers quickly and
            efficiently find the evidence they need. AI can also be used to
            deduplicate data and to tag data with metadata.

          <p class="card-text">
            AI can be used to create first drafts of legal documents, such as
            contracts, wills, and trusts. This can save lawyers time and allow
            them to focus on more complex tasks. AI can also be used to generate
            legal documents that are tailored to the specific needs of the
            client.

            AI can be used to review large amounts of documents, such as emails
            and financial records. This can help lawyers identify relevant
            documents and reduce the time spent on document review. AI can also
            be used to flag documents that may be important to the case.

            AI can be used to create transcripts of depositions, which are sworn
            statements taken from witnesses in a legal case. This can save
            lawyers time and allow them to focus on other aspects of the case.
            AI can also be used to identify key points in depositions and to
            generate summaries of the depositions.

            AI can be used to create virtual legal assistants that can help
            lawyers with tasks such as scheduling appointments and managing
            email. This can free up lawyers to focus on more important tasks. AI
            can also be used to generate reports that summarize the tasks that a
            virtual assistant has completed.
